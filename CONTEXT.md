# Notes App Context

Canonical vocabulary for product and engineering concepts used in code,
documentation, commits, prompts, and review.

This file owns ubiquitous language. Product requirements and decisions belong to the
detailed product specification; architecture belongs to `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Engineering Vocabulary

**Application Shell**  
The structural application frame that provides global layout, typography, viewport,
and theme context.  
_Avoid_: Master Page, App Wrapper

**Theme**  
The visual appearance mode applied across the interface: light, dark, or inherited
from the system preference. Runtime wiring belongs to `ARCHITECTURE.md`.  
_Avoid_: UI Skin, Theme Colorway

**UI Primitive**  
A reusable, domain-neutral interface building block from the shared UI layer. Its
visual semantics belong to `DESIGN.md` and coding rules to `CONVENTIONS.md`.  
_Avoid_: UI Widget, UI Gadget

**Component Story**  
An isolated state/example of a UI component rendered by the component workbench for
visual and interaction verification. Testing policy belongs to `TESTING.md`.  
_Avoid_: Story Mockup, Preview Fixture


## Product Vocabulary

The headings below preserve the vocabulary from former INTENT §4 so historical
references remain understandable while vocabulary has one canonical owner.

Single source of truth for project vocabulary. Format: **UI display name (PT-BR)** · `code_name (EN)`. The UI is in Portuguese (PT-BR); code, database, and API use the English name. Use these terms in code, schema, API, and UI; do not create synonyms. When a new term is approved, add it here.

### Account and Spaces

**Conta** · `Account`:  
Person who uses the app, identified by login. Each Account has its own Spaces; nothing is shared across Accounts.  
**Avoid in this product context:** user (in code), profile, workspace, team

**Space** · `Space`:  
A completely isolated knowledge context within an Account. Each Space has its own Types, Concepts, Collections, and Views. Objects from one Space never link to Objects in another.  
**Avoid in this product context:** Vault, Workspace, folder, project

**Mover** · `move`:  
Transfers an Object and its Dependents to another Space. Cross-space links are removed. Each Concept tagged on the Object is linked to the Concept of the same name or Synonym in the target Space or, if non-existent, created there without parents. All changes are previewed for confirmation.  
**Avoid in this product context:** copy, migrate, export/import

### Objects and Structure

**Objeto** · `Object`:  
Anything with its own identity in the app: Note, Concept, Highlight, Question, Source, or user-defined Object. Has title, Properties, content, and Links.  
**Avoid in this product context:** item, record, page, card

**Tipo** · `ObjectType`:  
Defines the structure of a set of Objects: their Properties, Templates, and default visualization. Includes built-in app Types (Note, Concept, Highlight, Question, PDF, Weblink, Video, Audio, Image, File, Table, Daily Note, Chat, Saved query) and user-defined Types (e.g., Book, Exam), matching Capacities. The user can convert an Object from one Type to another by mapping Properties.  
**Avoid in this product context:** category, class, database, template

**Campo** · `Property`:  
Structured data field defined on an ObjectType and populated on each Object (text, number, date, select, multi-select, checkbox, URL, relation to another Object). Built-in Types have fixed Properties and accept additional user-defined Properties.  
**Avoid in this product context:** property (in PT-BR UI), attribute, column, field

**Painel do Tipo** · `TypeDashboard`:  
Dedicated page for each ObjectType, identical to Capacities' Object Dashboard, with configurable sections: recent, without Concept, outside Collection, without Backlinks, Collections, and pinned Saved queries. Allows filtering, sorting, and grouping all Objects of that Type.

Initial content and Properties applied when instantiating an Object of a given Type.  
**Avoid in this product context:** model, skeleton

**Dependente** · `Dependent`:

**Avoid in this product context:** child, subitem, related

**Arquivar** · `archive`:  
Removes an Object from active circulation without deleting it: leaves Review, Mock Exams, Inbox, and default Views, while retaining content, Links, and history. The recommended path for Questions no longer actively studied.  
**Avoid in this product context:** hide, deactivate, conceal

**Lixeira** · `Trash`:  
Destination for deleted entities along with their Dependents. Retained for 30 days before permanent purging. Deleting a Question also deletes its Attempts.  
**Avoid in this product context:** archive, archived

### Links

**Link** · `Link`:  
Connection from one Object to another, created via `@` or `[[ ]]` in content or via a relation Property, identical to Capacities. Represents a single underlying relation regardless of where it was created.  
**Avoid in this product context:** relation (in UI), connection, reference

**Backlink** · `Backlink`:

**Avoid in this product context:** link suggestion

### Sources and Highlights

**Fonte** · `Source`:

Source representing a web page, identified by URL, stored with a saved local snapshot.  
**Avoid in this product context:** link, URL, bookmark, article

Always allows jumping back to the source location.  
**Avoid in this product context:** excerpt, annotation, marker

**Avoid in this product context:** clipper, web clipper, plugin

### Knowledge

**Conceito** · `Concept`:  
Subject matter the user wants to understand (e.g., OAuth 2.0). Functions as a tag with a dedicated page: can tag any Object, and its page gathers notes written on the topic, custom Properties (by default, Status: Not Started, Learning, Mastered; the user may add others), and everything tagged with it or its descendants. The sole tagging mechanism: separate tags do not exist.  
**Avoid in this product context:** Tag, topic, subject, category, MOC

Object automatically provisioned for each calendar day within a Space, matching Capacities, intended for rapid ephemeral logging.  
**Avoid in this product context:** journal, day note

### Study and Practice

**Questão** · `Question`:  
Single unified Object for active recall and practice. Formats: Q&A, cloze (fill-in-the-blank), and multiple choice. Used in two modes: Review and Mock Exam. Created standalone, extracted from selected excerpts, via `/questão` inline inside any Object, imported in bulk via file, or generated by agents via MCP; retains origin links when derived.  
**Avoid in this product context:** Flashcard, card, item, exercise

**Revisão** · `Review`:  
Spaced memorization mode: the app schedules Questions nearing forgetting (FSRS algorithm). After revealing the answer, the user selects Forgot, Earlier, Normal, or Later, with each button showing the scheduled interval; "Forgot" logs a failure.  
**Avoid in this product context:** study, daily review, flashcards

**Simulado** · `MockExam`:  
Exam simulation mode: Questions filtered by criteria, answered sequentially, optionally timed, with a final score. Configurable formats (default: multiple choice only); open formats without automatic grading are self-assessed.  
**Avoid in this product context:** test, exam, quiz, Simulation

**Tentativa** · `Attempt`:

**Avoid in this product context:** review log, response, history

**Plano de prova** · `ExamPlan`:  
Target exam date configured on an Exam Object or Saved query, matching RemNote's Exam Scheduler. Review mode prioritizes these Questions, paces new items to complete before the deadline, triggers a full review wave in the final days, and alerts if falling behind schedule.  
**Avoid in this product context:** cram, study schedule, syllabus

**Limite diário** · `DailyLimit`:  
Upper threshold on new Questions and daily reviews, along with target retention rate (e.g., 90%), matching Anki deck options and FSRS parameters.

**Avoid in this product context:** saved search, smart folder, query (in PT-BR UI)

**Collection** · `Collection`:  
Manually curated grouping of Objects sharing the same Type, identical to Capacities: the user hand-picks each member (e.g., "Questions to review before the exam").
