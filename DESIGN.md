description: Design system and component specification for Notes App based on shadcn/ui base-nova style with Base UI primitives, Tailwind CSS v4, and OKLCH color variables. This YAML frontmatter contains machine-readable tokens; the Markdown body provides rationale and usage guidance.

omitted:
  - section: spacing
    reason: "No project-level spacing token scale exists; Tailwind defaults and component-local values remain implementation details."

# Design System Specification

This file owns the **visual and interaction language**. Exact implementation details
belong to source code and code-writing rules to `CONVENTIONS.md`. The frontmatter
mirrors the design tokens implemented in `src/app/globals.css`; if they diverge,
the stylesheet is ground truth and this document is stale.

## Overview

The system uses shadcn/ui's `base-nova` preset on Base UI with Tailwind CSS v4.
The visual language is deliberately restrained:

- neutral, high-contrast OKLCH surfaces and text;
- semantic color roles instead of raw color selection;
- light/dark themes driven by CSS variables;
- modest depth, usually rings or restrained shadows;
- accessible focus and interaction states.

Not yet established: a product-specific grid/container system, custom breakpoint
scale, or formal elevation hierarchy.

## Colors

The `colors` token map is intentionally flat. Default-theme roles use names such as
`{colors.background}`; dark-theme counterparts use project naming such as
`{colors.dark-background}`. This keeps all machine-readable colors inside the
schema's `colors` group instead of introducing unsupported top-level theme groups.

Roles are:

- **Surface:** background, card, popover, sidebar.
- **Text:** foreground and role-specific foreground tokens.
- **Interactive:** primary, secondary, accent, ring.
- **Semantic:** destructive.
- **Structure:** border and input.

Dark/light pairing is a project naming convention; the runtime pairing itself is
implemented by the CSS variable blocks in `src/app/globals.css`.

## Typography & Fonts

- `{typography.heading}`: headings and emphasized structural labels.
- `{typography.body}`: default application copy.
- `{typography.mono}`: code and technical identifiers only.

Heading/body currently share Inter Variable with different weight intent; mono uses
Geist Mono. There is no product-specific type scale beyond configured Tailwind
utilities.

### Font Loading Invariants
- Typography must be loaded via `@fontsource-variable` or `next/font` with zero Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).
- Font definitions must specify pre-calculated fallback font metrics and `display: swap` to prevent text reflow during font hydration.

## Layout

The project has no shared spacing token scale, so the frontmatter deliberately marks
`spacing` as omitted. Layout spacing uses Tailwind defaults plus occasional
component-local implementation values.

No custom breakpoint scale or product grid/container system is defined. Promote a
layout rule to a design token only when a genuinely shared product pattern exists.

## Elevation & Depth

There is no formal elevation token scale.

- Simple surfaces generally prefer a subtle ring/hairline.
- Floating overlays may combine a restrained shadow with a ring.
- Match the nearest established surface role instead of inventing a new elevation
  value.
- Introduce named elevation tokens only when repeated product patterns justify a
  real hierarchy.

## Shapes

Radii derive from the shared `--radius` implementation and are represented in the
frontmatter as concrete dimension tokens. Change the shared radius system rather than
hardcoding one-off component radii.

## Components

The `components` frontmatter entries are representative examples of token
composition, not a source-file inventory.

Current shared UI families include actions/triggers, navigation/layout, overlays,
forms/input, data display/feedback, and conversational extensions.

### Application Component Composition

Product components compose the shared shadcn/Base UI primitives without cloning their
full public anatomy. A component name describes the product responsibility rather than
the primitive used internally; for example, `SettingsForm` may use `FieldGroup` as
its visual root. When a behavior-bearing Base UI primitive needs to render another
component, use its `render` composition API so focus, keyboard, ARIA, and state
behavior remain owned by the primitive. Application-level compound APIs are not used; each part is its own
single-component file.

Visual component structure must remain compatible with the interaction contract in
[ADR 0016](./docs/adr/0016-prefer-simple-domain-components-and-dedicated-hooks.md).

### Sidebar Navigation

The active Space route uses the shared, always-visible sidebar shell as its
primary navigation surface. The header contains the current Space switcher.
Space creation is available from the switcher menu. The content area contains
the route content and the footer contains the authenticated user's identity, a
dedicated sign-out action, and separate compact settings and theme controls in
a horizontal control row.

Sidebar rows use the same compact leading icon axis, a single-line truncated
label, and a visible active state that does not depend on color alone. Menus are
anchored to their trigger rows and must preserve keyboard focus, accessible names,
and mobile sheet behavior supplied by the shared sidebar primitives.

`src/components/ui/` is authoritative for exact component inventory and
implementation. `CONVENTIONS.md` owns component API/anatomy rules.
`TESTING.md` owns Ladle and visual-verification policy.

## Accessibility & Route Announcements

- **Next.js Route Announcer Invariant:** Next.js App Router announces client-side route transitions to screen readers using an accessibility precedence order: `document.title` -> first semantic `<h1>` element -> URL pathname. Every page must define descriptive metadata (`title`) and render exactly one semantic, accessible `<h1>` element.
- **WCAG 2.2 AA / AAA Compliance:** All UI token combinations must guarantee WCAG 2.2 AA contrast ratios ($\ge 4.5:1$ for standard text, $\ge 3:1$ for large text and UI components) and aim for AAA on core reader surfaces.
- **Reduced Motion:** All CSS animations and UI transitions must respect the user's OS preference using `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` or Tailwind `motion-reduce:*` variants.

## Asset & Image Guidelines

- **Next.js `<Image />` Usage:** Always render image assets with Next.js `next/image` to enforce layout stability and automated modern format conversion (AVIF/WebP).
- **Required Properties:** All image instances must provide explicit `width` and `height` dimensions (or `fill`), responsive `sizes` attributes for variable layouts, and `priority` on Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) above-the-fold candidates.

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do**

- use semantic color roles and token references;
- preserve light/dark behavior through shared CSS variables;
- choose surface depth and radius from the nearest established role;
- reuse existing primitives and visual states before introducing a new idiom;
- keep keyboard/focus interaction states visible;
- enforce WCAG 2.2 contrast and `prefers-reduced-motion` compliance.

**Don't**

- add unknown top-level frontmatter groups to model theme variants;
- hardcode component-specific colors when a semantic token owns the role;
- invent a spacing, breakpoint, radius, or elevation system for one component;
- use color alone to communicate selected, error, disabled, or loading state;
- use emojis as icons or visual indicators (use Lucide icons instead);
- omit descriptive titles or `<h1>` heading elements on page routes;
- put testing commands or React implementation patterns in this document.
